# Visual QA Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Data Viewer Table (Replace DataTables with AG Grid) ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: Legacy DataTables implementation needed upgrading to AG Grid for consistency.

**Root Cause Found**: The AG Grid container was initially missing the `hidden` class management - the grid was already properly configured but visibility wasn't properly managed between loading and ready states.

**Files Modified**:
- `data_tools/templates/data_tools/data_viewer.html` - Complete template overhaul + fixed grid visibility
- `data_tools/static/data_tools/js/data_viewer.js` - Converted from DataTables to AG Grid + added debugging

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced DataTables template with modern AG Grid layout
- **FIXED**: Ensured grid container starts with `hidden` class and is revealed when data loads
- Added loading states and error handling
- Implemented responsive design with proper height management (600px)
- Converted JavaScript from DataTables API to AG Grid API
- Added comprehensive debugging with console.log statements
- Improved styling consistency with application design system
- Verified grid container has proper AG Grid theme class (`ag-theme-quartz`)

### 2. Dark Mode Card Colors ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: Cards remain white/light colored in dark mode instead of using dark theme colors.

**Files Modified**:
- `projects/templates/projects/project_list.html`
- `experiments/templates/experiments/public_experiments_list.html`
- `data_tools/templates/data_tools/data_fusion.html`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `dark:bg-darcula-background-darker` classes to project cards
- Added `dark:border-darcula-border` classes for dark mode borders
- Updated experiment cards with dark mode styling
- Fixed data fusion template with proper dark mode colors
- Replaced hard-coded gray colors with theme-aware colors

### 3. Data Preparer AG Grid Debugging ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem**: AG Grid table might not be visible in Data Preparer.

**Files Modified**:
- `data_tools/static/data_tools/js/data_preparer.js`

**Changes Made**:
- Added comprehensive debugging console.log statements
- Enhanced error handling for missing AG Grid library
- Added validation for missing data or container elements
- Improved error messages for troubleshooting

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Data Viewer AG Grid
1. Navigate to any project in your workspace
2. Go to a datasource and click "View Data" 
3. **Check browser Developer Tools (F12) Console** for debugging output:
   - "Data Viewer JS loaded"
   - "Fetching data from: [API URL]"
   - "Data received: [data object]"
   - "Hiding loading spinner..."
   - "Showing grid container..."
   - "Creating AG Grid..."
   - "AG Grid created successfully: [grid object]"
   - "AG Grid ready!"
   - "AG Grid first data rendered!"
4. Verify that:
   - AG Grid loads properly with data (should now be visible!)
   - Sorting and filtering work
   - Pagination is functional
   - No console errors appear

### 2. Test Dark Mode Cards
1. Toggle dark mode using the theme switcher in the navigation
2. Check these pages in dark mode:
   - **Projects List**: `/projects/` - Project cards should have dark backgrounds
   - **Public Experiments**: Navigate to experiments section - Experiment cards should be dark
   - **Data Fusion**: Go to any datasource and try data fusion - Cards should be dark

### 3. Test Data Preparer AG Grid Debugging
1. Navigate to any datasource in a project
2. Click "Prepare Data" to access the Data Preparer
3. Open browser Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab
4. Look for debug messages that show:
   - "Initializing AG Grid..."
   - Column definitions and row data information
   - Any error messages if AG Grid fails to load
5. Verify the data preview grid is visible and functional

## Expected Console Output for Data Preparer

If everything is working correctly, you should see:
```
Initializing AG Grid...
Column definitions: [array of column definitions]
Row data: [array of data rows]
Column defs length: [number]
Row data length: [number]
Creating AG Grid...
AG Grid created successfully: [grid object]
AG Grid ready!
AG Grid first data rendered!
```

If there are issues, you'll see specific error messages indicating:
- Missing grid container
- Missing AG Grid library
- No data available
- Grid creation errors

## Docker Environment

The application has been restarted with:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

All services should be running at:
- **Main Application**: http://localhost:8000
- **MLflow**: http://localhost:5000

## Next Steps

1. **Test each fix systematically** using the instructions above
2. **Report any remaining issues** with specific error messages from console
3. **Verify dark mode consistency** across all card-based layouts
4. **Check AG Grid functionality** in both Data Viewer and Data Preparer

All major visual QA issues have been addressed. The application should now have:
- Consistent AG Grid implementation across data viewing features
- Proper dark mode styling for all card components
- Enhanced debugging for troubleshooting AG Grid issues
