- `TASKS_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` → `docs/implementation/`

### 4. Security Enhancements

#### Django Settings Improvements:
```python
# Added production security settings
if not DEBUG:
    SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000  # 1 year
    SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True
    SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True
    SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = os.getenv('SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT', 'False') == 'True'
```

#### Security Features Implemented:
- HSTS headers for HTTPS enforcement
- Enhanced environment variable configuration
- Improved SSL redirect handling
- Comprehensive security headers

### 5. Docker Configuration Optimization

#### Enhancements Made:
```yaml
# Added health checks for all services
db:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U hydro_user -d hydro_db"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3

redis:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3
```

#### Benefits:
- Better service monitoring
- Improved startup reliability
- Enhanced container health visibility
- More robust deployment process

### 6. Code Quality Improvements

#### Optimizations Applied:
- **Import cleanup**: Removed unused imports and cleaned comments
- **URL structure optimization**: Better organized and commented
