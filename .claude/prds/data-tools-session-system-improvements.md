# PRD: Data Tools Session System Improvements

## Executive Summary

The current Data Tools session system has architectural debt with dual implementations causing maintenance complexity and potential data inconsistency. This PRD outlines the consolidation and improvement of the session system to create a single, robust solution that provides reliable undo/redo functionality, proper session persistence, and improved security.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
The Data Tools currently has two parallel session implementations (Redis-based and file-based) creating:
- Maintenance burden and code duplication
- Potential data inconsistency between systems
- Incomplete redo functionality
- Security vulnerabilities in data serialization
- Hardcoded configuration values

**Why is this important now?**
As the Data Tools system scales and more users perform complex data transformations, session reliability becomes critical. The current dual implementation creates risk of data loss and user frustration. Consolidating to a single, well-tested system ensures data integrity and improves user experience.

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas
1. **Data Analyst**: Performs multi-step data transformations and needs reliable undo/redo
2. **Data Scientist**: Works with large datasets requiring session persistence during long operations
3. **Business User**: Needs simple, reliable data manipulation without technical complexity

### Detailed User Journeys

**Story 1: Reliable Data Transformation History**
- As a data analyst, I want to perform multiple data transformations with confidence that I can undo any step
- I need the undo/redo functionality to work consistently without data corruption
- I want to see the current state of my transformation history

**Story 2: Session Persistence**
- As a data scientist, I want my session to persist during long-running operations
- I need configurable session timeouts based on my work patterns
- I want to be warned before my session expires with option to extend

**Story 3: Data Security**
- As a security-conscious user, I need assurance that my data transformations are stored securely
- I want to know that session data cannot be tampered with or corrupted

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Inconsistent session behavior due to dual implementations
- Failed redo operations with cryptic error messages
- Unexpected session timeouts during active work
- Maintenance complexity for development team

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Session Management**
- Single, unified session implementation
- Complete undo/redo functionality with full operation history
- Session state persistence across browser sessions
- Configurable session timeouts with extension capability
- Session cleanup and garbage collection
- Save session as new datasource functionality

**User Interface**
- Clear visual indicators of session state
- Undo/redo buttons with operation preview
- Session timeout warnings with extension options
- Progress indicators for long-running operations

**Data Operations**
- Support for all current data transformation types
- Efficient storage of large dataset changes
- Atomic operations to prevent partial state corruption
- Performance optimization for rapid successive operations

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Expectations**
- Session operations complete within 200ms for typical datasets
- Support for datasets up to 100MB in session memory
- Undo/redo operations complete within 100ms
- Session initialization within 500ms

**Security Considerations**
- Secure serialization without pickle vulnerabilities
- Session data encryption at rest
- User-scoped session isolation
- Audit trail of session operations

**Scalability Needs**
- Support for 100 concurrent user sessions
- Efficient memory management for long-running sessions
- Horizontal scaling capability for session storage
- Resource limits to prevent abuse

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- Zero session-related data corruption incidents
- 99.9% undo/redo operation success rate
- Average session operation response time < 200ms
- User session timeout complaints reduced by 90%
- Code complexity reduced by 50% (eliminate dual implementation)

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Session operation latency (P95 < 300ms)
- Session persistence rate (99%+ successful saves)
- User satisfaction score for undo/redo functionality (>8/10)
- Developer productivity: time to implement new session features (50% reduction)
- System reliability: session-related error rate (<0.1%)

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing user sessions
- Redis infrastructure capacity (current 4GB limit)
- Django framework constraints for session middleware
- Browser localStorage limitations for client-side state

### Timeline Constraints
- Implementation must be completed within 4 weeks
- Cannot disrupt current user workflows during migration
- Must have rollback plan for production deployment

### Resource Limitations
- Single developer allocated for implementation
- Limited QA testing time (1 week)
- No additional infrastructure budget for new components

## Out of Scope

**What we're explicitly NOT building:**
- Real-time collaborative editing of sessions
- Session sharing between multiple users
- Advanced analytics on session usage patterns
- Integration with external data versioning systems
- Mobile app session synchronization
- Advanced conflict resolution for simultaneous operations
