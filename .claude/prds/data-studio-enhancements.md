# PRD: data-studio-enhancements

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the completion of critical Data Studio enhancements that will significantly improve user experience for data scientists and analysts working with large datasets. We're addressing four key areas: pagination controls, filter interface optimization, active state indicators, and session management reliability. These improvements will reduce user frustration, increase data exploration efficiency, and ensure robust error handling for production use.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
The HydroML Data Studio currently has four critical user experience gaps that impact daily workflows:

1. **Limited Navigation**: Users cannot efficiently navigate through large datasets due to missing pagination controls
2. **Poor Filter Experience**: Current filter interface lacks intuitive controls and visual feedback
3. **Navigation Confusion**: Users lose context of their current location within the application
4. **Session Failures**: Unreliable session initialization creates workflow interruptions

### Why is this important now?
- **User Productivity**: These issues directly impact data scientist efficiency and workflow completion
- **Production Readiness**: Session failures affect system reliability in production environments
- **Competitive Advantage**: Enhanced UX differentiates HydroML from alternative data analysis tools
- **User Retention**: Poor UX leads to user abandonment and reduced platform adoption

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Data Scientist (Sarah)**
- Analyzes datasets with 10K+ rows daily
- Needs efficient navigation and filtering capabilities
- Values reliable session management for long-running transformations

**Business Analyst (Marcus)** 
- Explores multiple datasets to extract insights
- Requires clear navigation context and visual feedback
- Needs intuitive filter controls for data segmentation

**ML Engineer (Ana)**
- Processes large datasets for model training
- Depends on robust session management for data pipeline reliability
- Values clear error messages and recovery mechanisms

### Detailed User Journeys

**Journey 1: Large Dataset Navigation**
1. Sarah loads a 50K row dataset in Data Studio
2. She needs to examine rows 1000-1050 specifically
3. Currently: Must manually adjust page size and calculate page numbers
4. **Solution**: Direct pagination controls allow jumping to specific row ranges

**Journey 2: Data Filtering and Exploration**
1. Marcus wants to filter customers by region and revenue
2. Currently: Filter interface provides minimal feedback and is hard to use
3. **Solution**: Enhanced filter controls with multi-select, presets, and clear visual feedback

**Journey 3: Session Recovery**
1. Ana starts a complex data transformation session
2. Session fails to initialize with unclear error message
3. Currently: Must restart entire workflow with no guidance
4. **Solution**: Robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and clear recovery instructions

### Pain Points Being Addressed

- **Context Loss**: Users lose track of their position in large datasets
- **Filter Frustration**: Current filtering is slow and unintuitive  
- **Error Ambiguity**: Session failures provide no actionable guidance
- **Navigation Inefficiency**: Manual page calculation wastes time

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### F1: Advanced Pagination System
- **F1.1**: Next/Previous page navigation buttons
- **F1.2**: Jump to specific page functionality  
- **F1.3**: Rows per page selector (10, 25, 50, 100, All)
- **F1.4**: Current page indicator with total pages
- **F1.5**: Row range display (e.g., "Showing 26-50 of 1,247")

#### F2: Enhanced Filter Interface
- **F2.1**: Multi-select filter capabilities for categorical data
- **F2.2**: Range sliders for numerical data filtering
- **F2.3**: Filter preset save/load functionality
- **F2.4**: Clear all filters button
- **F2.5**: Active filter indicators with removal capability
- **F2.6**: Filter search with auto-suggestions

#### F3: Active State Indicators
- **F3.1**: Visual highlight of current navigation section
- **F3.2**: Breadcrumb active state styling
- **F3.3**: Side navigation current page highlighting
- **F3.4**: Progress indicators for multi-step workflows

#### F4: Robust Session Management
- **F4.1**: Retry mechanism for failed session initialization
- **F4.2**: Detailed error messages with specific actions
- **F4.3**: Session state persistence across page reloads
- **F4.4**: Automatic session recovery attempts
- **F4.5**: Grace period for temporary connection issues

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NF1: Performance
- Pagination controls must respond within 200ms
- Filter application must complete within 500ms for datasets up to 100K rows
- Session initialization must succeed within 10 seconds

#### NF2: Accessibility
- All controls must be keyboard navigable
- Screen reader compatible with ARIA labels
- High contrast mode support
- Focus indicators clearly visible

#### NF3: Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile responsive design

#### NF4: Reliability
