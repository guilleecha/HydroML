# PRD: ML Experiment Form Improvements

## Executive Summary

HydroML's current ML experiment creation workflow, while functional, lacks modern MLOps best practices and optimal user experience patterns. This enhancement will redesign the experiment form interface, implement progressive disclosure, add intelligent defaults, and integrate experiment tracking best practices to create a more intuitive and efficient ML workflow for data scientists.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues Identified

1. **Complex Single-Form Approach**: All experiment configuration is presented in one long form, overwhelming new users
2. **Missing Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced options are shown alongside basic settings, creating cognitive overload  
3. **Weak Feature Selection UX**: Current two-column selection interface is clunky and error-prone
4. **No Intelligent Defaults**: Users must configure every parameter manually without guidance
5. **Lack of Experiment Templates**: No pre-configured workflows for common ML tasks
6. **Missing Validation Feedback**: Limited real-time validation and guidance during form completion
7. **No Hyperparameter Optimization**: Only basic hyperparameter inputs, no HPO integration
8. **Weak Reproducibility Controls**: Random state and versioning are basic text fields

### Why This is Critical Now

Based on MLOps best practices research, poor experiment setup UX directly impacts:
- **Time to First Success**: New users struggle to create their first successful experiment
- **Reproducibility**: Inconsistent parameter setting leads to non-reproducible results
- **Experiment Quality**: Poor defaults result in suboptimal model performance
- **Team Collaboration**: Lack of templates makes knowledge sharing difficult

## User Stories

### Primary Persona: Data Scientist (Intermediate Level)

**Story 1: Quick Experiment Creation**
> As a data scientist, I want to create a basic experiment in under 2 minutes with intelligent defaults, so I can quickly validate my hypothesis without extensive configuration.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Default model selection based on dataset characteristics
- Auto-populated hyperparameters with proven defaults
- One-click feature selection with correlation filtering
- Instant dataset preview in form

**Story 2: Advanced Configuration Control**
> As an experienced ML practitioner, I want granular control over experiment parameters through progressive disclosure, so I can optimize for specific use cases without UI clutter.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Advanced options hidden by default but easily accessible
- Hyperparameter optimization configuration
- Custom validation strategy setup
- Experiment templates and presets

**Story 3: Reproducible Experiment Setup**
> As a team lead, I want experiment configurations to be reproducible and shareable, so team members can build upon each other's work consistently.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Automated experiment versioning
- Configuration export/import
- Template creation from successful experiments
- Dependency tracking and environment capture

  - "Quick Baseline Comparison"
- Custom template creation from successful experiments
- Template sharing across projects

#### 5. Real-Time Validation & Feedback

2. **Distributed Training**: Multi-node training configuration
3. **Custom Model Architectures**: Deep learning model builder interface
4. **Real-time Model Serving**: Deployment and serving configuration
5. **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Custom transformation pipeline builder
