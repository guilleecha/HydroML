# PRD: wave-theme-integration

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of Wave-inspired theme system and component patterns in HydroML to achieve consistent, professional UI/UX across the platform. By adapting DevDojo's Wave design patterns to Django + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS architecture, we'll create a unified design system that improves developer experience, reduces code duplication, and provides users with a cohesive interface experience throughout the platform.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

**Current HydroML UI Challenges:**
1. **Inconsistent Design Patterns**: Different pages use varying component styles and layouts
2. **Code Duplication**: Similar UI components recreated across different Django apps
3. **No Unified Theme System**: Lack of centralized styling and component management
4. **Developer Experience**: Difficult to maintain UI consistency when building new features
5. **Professional Polish**: Missing cohesive design system for enterprise-level appearance

### Why is this important now?

- **User Experience**: Inconsistent UI creates confusion and reduces professional credibility
- **Developer Productivity**: Component reuse reduces development time and maintenance overhead
- **Scalability**: Theme system enables rapid feature development with consistent styling
- **Brand Identity**: Unified design system strengthens HydroML as a professional platform
- **Maintenance Cost**: Centralized components reduce long-term maintenance burden

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Frontend Developer (Carlos)**
- Builds new features for HydroML modules
- Needs consistent components and patterns to follow
- Values reusable components and clear documentation
- Wants to focus on functionality rather than reinventing UI patterns

**UI/UX Designer (Maria)**
- Responsible for maintaining visual consistency across HydroML
- Needs standardized components and design tokens
- Values systematic approach to design implementation
- Requires ability to make global design changes efficiently

**End User (Data Scientist - Sarah)**
- Uses HydroML daily for data analysis and ML workflows
- Expects consistent, intuitive interface across all modules
- Values familiar patterns and predictable interactions

### Detailed User Journeys

**Journey 1: Component Development**
1. Carlos needs to build a new settings page
2. Currently: Must research existing patterns, copy-paste code, customize styling
3. **Solution**: Access component library, use standardized form components and layouts
4. Result: 60% reduction in UI development time, guaranteed consistency

**Journey 2: Design System Updates**
1. Maria needs to update button styles across the entire platform
2. Currently: Must manually find and update styles in multiple template files
3. **Solution**: Update design tokens in theme system, changes propagate automatically
4. Result: Global changes implemented in minutes rather than hours

**Journey 3: User Experience**
1. Sarah navigates between Data Studio, Experiments, and Projects modules
2. Currently: Each module feels different, requires learning new interaction patterns
3. **Solution**: Consistent navigation, forms, buttons, and layout patterns
4. Result: Seamless experience, reduced cognitive load, improved productivity

### Pain Points Being Addressed

- **Development Inefficiency**: Recreating similar components across different modules
- **Visual Inconsistency**: Different styling approaches creating fragmented experience
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Updates require changes in multiple locations
- **Onboarding Friction**: New developers struggle with inconsistent patterns
- **User Confusion**: Inconsistent interfaces require users to relearn patterns
