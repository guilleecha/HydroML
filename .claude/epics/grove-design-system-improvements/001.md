# Issue #001: Component Library Inventory and Analysis

## Objective
Create comprehensive inventory of existing Grove and Wave components, analyze usage patterns, and identify consolidation opportunities.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Component Discovery
1. **Scan all CSS component files**
   - Grove components in `core/static/core/css/components/grove-*.css`
   - Wave components in `core/static/core/css/components/wave-components.css`
   - Specialized components in `*-components.css` files

2. **Catalog component classes**
   - Create structured inventory with component names, purposes, and files
   - Document color schemes, sizing variants, and states
   - Identify overlapping functionality between Grove and Wave

3. **Usage analysis**
   - Search templates for component usage patterns
   - Identify most/least used components
   - Find hardcoded styles that should be components

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis
1. **Missing components identification**
   - Components needed but not available in Grove
   - Wave components without Grove equivalents
   - Custom CSS that should be standardized

2. **Inconsistency detection**
   - Different naming conventions
   - Color/spacing variations
   - Accessibility gaps

### Deliverables
1. **Component inventory spreadsheet** (JSON format)
2. **Usage report** with statistics and recommendations
3. **Migration roadmap** prioritizing high-impact consolidations

## Files to Analyze
- `core/static/core/css/components/*.css`
- `core/static/core/css/design-tokens.css`
- All template files using component classes
- Custom CSS files in app-specific directories

## Success Criteria
- Complete catalog of all components (Grove, Wave, specialized)
- Clear recommendations for component consolidation
- Priority list for migration tasks
- Documentation of usage patterns and dependencies
