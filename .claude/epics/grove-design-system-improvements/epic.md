# Epic: Grove Design System Consolidation

## Overview
Consolidate and standardize the Grove Design System by migrating from Wave components to Grove components, eliminating CSS duplication, and establishing clear component library governance.

## Business Objectives
- **Reduce development time** by providing consistent, reusable components
- **Improve user experience** through design consistency across the platform
- **Enhance maintainability** by consolidating overlapping component libraries
- **Future-proof the design system** with proper tooling and documentation

## Epic Scope
- Component library inventory and analysis
- Grove component standardization and enhancement
- Template migration from Wave to Grove components  
- Testing and visual validation
- Documentation and developer experience improvements

## Technical Architecture
- **Grove Design System**: Primary component library with design tokens
- **Wave Components**: Legacy system to be phased out gradually
- **Specialized Components**: Domain-specific components aligned with Grove patterns
- **Design Tokens**: Centralized theming and consistency system

## Success Metrics
- **Component consolidation**: Reduce component duplication by 60%
- **Bundle size**: Maintain or improve CSS performance metrics
- **Developer productivity**: Faster component discovery and implementation
- **Design consistency**: 100% Grove adoption across templates
- **Accessibility**: All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 25 hours across 5 issues
- **Priority**: High (foundational improvement)
- **Status**: Ready for execution

## Task Breakdown
1. **Issue #001**: Component Library Inventory (4h) - Ready
2. **Issue #002**: Grove Component Standardization (6h) - Ready  
3. **Issue #003**: Template Migration and Cleanup (8h) - Blocked by #001, #002
4. **Issue #004**: Testing and Visual Validation (4h) - Blocked by #002, #003
5. **Issue #005**: Documentation and Developer Experience (3h) - Blocked by all

## Dependencies
- No external dependencies
- Internal dependency chain: 001,002 → 003 → 004 → 005
- Parallel execution possible for issues 001 and 002

## Risk Mitigation
- **Visual regressions**: Comprehensive testing and component showcase
- **Performance impact**: CSS optimization and bundle analysis
- **Developer adoption**: Clear documentation and migration guides
- **Breaking changes**: Gradual migration with backward compatibility
