# Epic: PRD: data-studio-complete-data-manipulation-tool

## Overview
Epic automatically generated from PRD: data-studio-table-nan-cleanup
This epic implements the requirements specified in the Product Requirements Document.

## Business Objectives
Provide complete data manipulation pipeline from raw data to experiment-ready datasets, eliminating need for external tools and establishing Grove as complete data science platform.

## Epic Scope
Transform Data Studio into a comprehensive data manipulation tool with enhanced table view, formula engine, NaN cleanup, and export capabilities following Grove design system.

## Technical Architecture
- Enhanced AG Grid with pagination, sorting, filtering
- Formula engine supporting `@column_name` syntax
- Contextual toolbar or Wave-style sidebar integration
- Grove design system compliance with monochromatic aesthetics
- Backend: Django + Celery + Redis for async processing

## Success Metrics
- 70% reduction in data preparation time
- 60% adoption of formula engine
- 80% export usage rate
- 50% fewer ML experiment data quality issues

## Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Ready for decomposition

## Task Breakdown
1. **UI Architecture Research** - Evaluate headbar toolbar vs Wave-style sidebar options, identify Grove patterns
2. **Enhanced Data Table** - Implement AG Grid with pagination, sorting, filtering, Grove styling
3. **Session Integration** - Ensure existing session system works with new layout
4. **NaN Detection Tools** - Visual highlighting and removal tools for missing values
5. **Column Management** - Rename, delete, reorder columns functionality
6. **Basic Export System** - CSV and JSON export with configurable options
7. **Formula Engine Core** - Expression parser supporting `@column_name` references
8. **Mathematical Operations** - Basic math operations (+, -, *, **, /) in formulas
9. **Formula Builder UI** - Interactive modal with syntax highlighting and autocomplete
10. **Data Imputation** - Statistical methods for missing value imputation
11. **Experiment Validator** - Dataset quality and readiness check indicators
12. **Advanced Export** - Excel and Parquet format support

## Dependencies
- Grove Design System: Complete component library with navigation patterns
- AG Grid License: Enterprise features for enhanced table functionality  
- Backend Infrastructure: Celery + Redis setup for async processing

## Risk Mitigation
- **Formula Engine Complexity**: Start with basic operations, iterate based on feedback
- **AG Grid Performance**: Implement pagination and virtual scrolling for large datasets
- **Grove UI Integration**: Research existing patterns first, avoid new design components
- **Scope Creep**: Strict phase-based implementation, resist feature additions

## Definition of Done
- All tasks completed and tested
- PRD requirements fully implemented
- Success metrics achieved
- Quality standards met
