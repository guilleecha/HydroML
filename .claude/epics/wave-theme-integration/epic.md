# Epic: Wave Theme Integration

## Overview
Implementation of Wave-inspired theme system and component patterns for consistent HydroML UI/UX. This epic transforms the current fragmented UI approach into a unified design system that improves developer experience, reduces code duplication, and provides users with a cohesive interface experience.

## Business Objectives
- **Developer Productivity**: 50% reduction in UI component development time
- **Code Reuse**: 80% of UI components use standardized theme system
- **Visual Consistency**: >90% consistency across platform modules
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: 70% reduction in time for global UI updates

## Epic Scope
Based on the Wave Theme Integration PRD, this epic addresses:
- Inconsistent design patterns across HydroML modules
- Code duplication in UI components
- Lack of unified theme system
- Poor developer experience for UI development
- Missing professional polish for enterprise-level appearance

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend Stack**: Django 5.2.4 + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Component System**: Reusable Alpine.js components with standardized APIs
- **Theme Engine**: Centralized design tokens and configuration system
- **Template Integration**: Django template inheritance with theme-aware base templates

## Success Metrics
- Component reuse rate across Django apps
- Theme system adoption rate in new features
- CSS/JS bundle size optimization
- Page load time impact measurements
- Developer satisfaction scores (target: >4.5/5)

## Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 8 weeks
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) - Tasks #15, #16
- **Phase 2**: Core Components (Weeks 3-4) - Tasks #17, #18, #19
- **Phase 3**: Integration (Weeks 5-6) - Tasks #20, #21
- **Phase 4**: Polish & Documentation (Weeks 7-8) - Task #22

## Task Breakdown
1. **#15** - Design Token Foundation System
2. **#16** - Component Architecture and Registration System
3. **#17** - Layout Patterns and Template System
4. **#18** - Runtime Theme Configuration System
5. **#19** - Wave-Inspired Component Library
6. **#20** - Django Template Integration and Context Processors
7. **#21** - Performance Optimization and Bundle Management
8. **#22** - Comprehensive Documentation and Style Guide

## Dependencies
- Current Tailwind CSS configuration
- Alpine.js framework capabilities
- Django template system compatibility
- Static file management pipeline

## Risk Mitigation
- **Gradual Implementation**: Phased rollout to minimize disruption
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous measurement during development
- **Team Training**: Documentation and knowledge transfer sessions
- **Fallback Strategy**: Ability to disable features if critical issues arise

## Definition of Done
- All 8 tasks completed and tested
- Component library fully documented
- Theme system integrated across existing modules
- Performance benchmarks met
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) achieved
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
