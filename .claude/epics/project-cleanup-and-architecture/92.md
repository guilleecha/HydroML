# Task 009: Reusable Component Patterns

**Epic**: Project Cleanup and Architecture  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Assignee**: TBD  
**Created**: 2025-08-24T17:36:31Z  
**Updated**: 2025-08-24T17:36:31Z  

## Objective
Create standardized panel system for upload/experiment modals, implement generic Grove component patterns, and establish reusable partial templates to reduce code duplication and improve consistency across the application.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: 005 (Template Consolidation and Cleanup), 006 (Grove Design System Integration), 007 (Static Asset Management)
- **Parallel**: false

## Scope
- Design and implement standardized panel system for modals
- Create generic Grove component patterns for common UI elements
- Establish reusable partial templates for repeated structures
- Test component functionality and cross-template consistency

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Standardized Panel System
- [ ] Analyze existing modal structures across upload/experiment interfaces
- [ ] Design unified panel component architecture using Grove design system
- [ ] Create base modal template with consistent header/body/footer structure
- [ ] Implement standardized action button patterns
- [ ] Add responsive behavior and accessibility features

### 2. Generic Grove Component Patterns
- [ ] Identify common UI patterns across applications (forms, lists, cards)
- [ ] Create Grove-based component templates for:
  - Form layouts with consistent validation display
  - Data display cards with standardized headers/actions
  - Navigation patterns with unified styling
  - Status indicators and badges
- [ ] Establish naming conventions for component classes
- [ ] Document usage patterns and examples

### 3. Reusable Partial Templates
- [ ] Extract common template structures into partials:
  - Form field rendering with Grove styling
  - Action button groups with consistent spacing
  - Status displays and progress indicators
  - Error/success message patterns
- [ ] Create template composition guidelines
- [ ] Implement context passing standards for partials
- [ ] Add template documentation comments

### 4. Component Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test component rendering across different contexts
- [ ] Validate accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior on multiple screen sizes
- [ ] Test component composition and nesting
- [ ] Validate Grove design system integration

## Expected Deliverables
- Standardized modal/panel component system
- Library of reusable Grove component patterns
- Collection of optimized partial templates
- Component usage documentation and examples
- Test suite validating component functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Modal system works consistently across upload/experiment interfaces
- [ ] Grove components follow established design system patterns
- [ ] Partial templates reduce code duplication by 40%+
- [ ] All components pass accessibility validation
- [ ] Components render correctly on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Template composition follows documented standards

## Technical Notes
- Use Grove design system CSS classes and custom properties
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing templates
- Ensure proper context variable handling in partials
- Follow Django template best practices for includes/extends
- Implement proper error handling for missing context variables

## Files to Modify/Create
- `core/templates/core/components/` (new component templates)
- `core/templates/core/partials/` (reusable partial templates)
- `core/static/core/css/components/` (component-specific styling)
- Various application templates (experiments, projects, data_tools)
- Template documentation and usage examples

## Testing Requirements
- Component rendering tests across different contexts
- Accessibility compliance validation
- Responsive design testing on multiple devices
- Template composition and nesting validation
- Grove design system integration verification
