# Task: Static File System Cleanup

## Description
Clean up the static file system by removing Node.js development artifacts, consolidating duplicate CSS/JS files, and removing demo/testing artifacts while ensuring the deployment build process remains functional.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove all Node.js development artifacts from staticfiles/ directory
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate CSS/JS files across static directories (core/, data_tools/, etc.)
- [ ] Clean demo and testing artifacts with proper usage verification
- [ ] Validate deployment build process (collectstatic) still functions correctly
- [ ] Remove unused logo files and test images from core/static/core/img/
- [ ] Clean up deleted template references from staticfiles/
- [ ] Ensure all remaining static files are properly organized and documented

## Technical Details
- Remove staticfiles/core/img/logos/test/ directory and unused logo variants
- Consolidate CSS files: Remove duplicates between source and staticfiles
- Clean up deleted template copies in staticfiles/ directories
- Verify staticfiles/ regeneration through collectstatic command
- Update static file references in templates if needed
- Preserve critical static assets required for production deployment

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 - Project Analysis and Documentation (for file usage analysis)
- [ ] Working Docker environment for testing collectstatic

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8
- Parallel: false
