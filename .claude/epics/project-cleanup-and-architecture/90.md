# Task: CSS Loading Order Optimization

## Description
Implement Grove → Tailwind CSS cascade optimization by extracting critical CSS for FOUC prevention and creating dedicated CSS loading partial files. Test CSS loading across all components to ensure proper styling hierarchy and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement optimal CSS cascade: Critical → Grove → Tailwind → App-specific
- [ ] Extract critical CSS for above-the-fold content to prevent FOUC
- [ ] Create dedicated CSS loading partial templates for modular inclusion
- [ ] Optimize CSS file sizes and loading performance
- [ ] Test CSS loading across all Grove and legacy components
- [ ] Verify proper CSS specificity and cascade behavior
- [ ] Ensure dark/light theme switching works correctly
- [ ] Validate responsive design across all breakpoints

## Technical Details
- Create core/templates/core/partials/_css_critical.html for critical styles
- Create core/templates/core/partials/_css_grove.html for Grove system styles
- Create core/templates/core/partials/_css_tailwind.html for Tailwind utilities
- Create core/templates/core/partials/_css_app.html for app-specific styles
- Extract critical CSS from static/css/output.css for inline inclusion
- Optimize Grove component CSS loading order in grove-*.css files
- Implement CSS preloading for non-critical stylesheets
- Test CSS cascade across all major pages: dashboard, data_studio, experiments
- Verify Grove card, navigation, modal, and sidebar components render correctly
- Test CSS performance and loading metrics

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 005 - Base Template Restructure Implementation (template structure needed)
- [ ] Grove design system components available
- [ ] Tailwind CSS build system configured
