# Task: Template Architecture Foundation

## Description
Create a modular base template structure with proper CSS loading order and establish the foundation for clean template inheritance patterns. This includes creating base_grove.html and extracting critical CSS to dedicated partials.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create modular base template structure (base_grove.html) as primary template
- [ ] Extract critical CSS to dedicated partial templates (_critical_css.html)
- [ ] Create proper CSS loading order partials for Grove components
- [ ] Test basic template inheritance works across all major pages
- [ ] Establish consistent head section structure with proper meta tags
- [ ] Create reusable partial templates for common UI patterns
- [ ] Ensure proper CSS cascade and specificity management

## Technical Details
- Create core/templates/core/base_grove.html as new primary base template
- Extract CSS loading to core/templates/core/partials/_grove_css.html
- Create core/templates/core/partials/_critical_css.html for above-fold styles
- Update existing templates to extend base_grove.html instead of base_main.html
- Implement proper CSS loading order: Critical CSS → Grove components → App-specific CSS
- Test template inheritance on dashboard, data_studio, experiments pages
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility standards are maintained

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 - Static File System Cleanup (clean static structure)
- [ ] Task 003 - Legacy Component Migration Analysis (Grove components ready)
- [ ] Working development environment for testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-10
