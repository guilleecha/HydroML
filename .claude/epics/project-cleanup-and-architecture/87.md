# Task: Project Analysis and Documentation

## Description
Conduct comprehensive analysis of the HydroML codebase to identify cleanup opportunities, document current component relationships and dependencies, and establish safety protocols for the cleanup process. This foundational analysis will guide all subsequent cleanup tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete file usage analysis across all static directories with verification
- [ ] Document current component relationships and dependencies in detail
- [ ] Create detailed cleanup and migration recommendations with risk assessment
- [ ] Establish testing protocols and safety measures for cleanup operations
- [ ] Generate comprehensive inventory of duplicate files and unused assets
- [ ] Document current template inheritance patterns and component loading order
- [ ] Create rollback procedures for each cleanup phase

## Technical Details
- Analyze staticfiles/ directory structure and identify Node.js artifacts
- Map CSS/JS file relationships across core/, data_tools/, experiments/, projects/
- Document Wave vs Grove component usage patterns
- Identify critical vs non-critical static assets
- Review template inheritance hierarchy and CSS loading patterns
- Create automated verification scripts for file usage detection

## Dependencies
- [ ] Access to full codebase and git history
- [ ] Working development environment for testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Changes validated
- [ ] Comprehensive analysis report generated with actionable recommendations
- [ ] Safety protocols established and documented
