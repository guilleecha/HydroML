# Task 011: Testing and Validation Framework

**Epic**: Project Cleanup and Architecture  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Assignee**: TBD  
**Created**: 2025-08-24T17:36:31Z  
**Updated**: 2025-08-24T17:36:31Z  

## Objective
Implement comprehensive Playwright testing for all architectural changes, validate template rendering and functionality, conduct cross-browser and mobile responsive testing, and perform performance testing with regression validation.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: 009 (Reusable Component Patterns)
- **Parallel**: false

## Scope
- Comprehensive Playwright testing suite for all UI changes
- Template rendering and functionality validation across applications
- Cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsive testing
- Performance testing and regression validation framework

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Playwright Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up comprehensive Playwright testing environment
- [ ] Configure multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Implement mobile device emulation testing
- [ ] Set up parallel test execution for performance
- [ ] Configure screenshot comparison and visual regression testing

### 2. Template Rendering Validation
- [ ] Create tests for all consolidated templates:
  - Dashboard and navigation components
  - Data Studio interface and sidebar
  - Experiment wizard and forms
  - Project management interfaces
  - Account and settings pages
- [ ] Validate Grove component rendering across all contexts
- [ ] Test template inheritance and partial inclusion
- [ ] Verify context variable handling and error states

### 3. Functionality Testing Suite
- [ ] Test interactive components and user workflows:
  - Navigation and routing functionality
  - Form submission and validation
  - Modal and dropdown interactions
  - Data table operations and filtering
  - Session management features
- [ ] Validate accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

### 4. Cross-Browser and Responsive Testing
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- [ ] Validate mobile responsiveness on:
  - iPhone (various sizes)
  - Android devices
  - Tablet form factors
- [ ] Test touch interactions and mobile navigation
- [ ] Verify font rendering and layout consistency

### 5. Performance and Regression Testing
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarking:
  - Page load time measurements
  - CSS and JavaScript bundle size validation
  - First contentful paint (FCP) metrics
  - Largest contentful paint (LCP) metrics
- [ ] Create regression testing framework:
  - Visual regression testing with screenshot comparison
  - Functional regression testing for key workflows
  - Performance regression detection

### 6. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test component integration across applications
- [ ] Validate Grove design system consistency
- [ ] Test template composition and nesting
- [ ] Verify API integration with frontend changes
- [ ] Test Docker environment compatibility

## Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive Playwright testing suite (50+ test scenarios)
- Cross-browser compatibility validation reports
- Mobile responsive testing validation
- Performance testing framework and baseline metrics
- Regression testing automation with CI integration
- Accessibility compliance validation reports

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All major user workflows have automated tests
- [ ] Tests pass on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness validated on 5+ device types
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet established targets:
  - Page load time < 2 seconds
  - CSS bundle size reduced by 40%+
  - JavaScript bundle size reduced by 30%+
- [ ] Accessibility compliance validated (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Regression testing framework operational
- [ ] Test suite execution time < 15 minutes

## Technical Notes
- Use Playwright's built-in assertions and waiting strategies
- Implement proper test data setup and teardown
- Use Docker environment for consistent testing
- Configure CI/CD integration for automated testing
- Implement test result reporting and notifications

## Test Categories and Coverage

### Core Navigation Testing
- Header navigation and user menu
- Sidebar navigation and session controls
- Breadcrumb navigation and routing
- Mobile navigation and hamburger menu

### Application-Specific Testing
- **Dashboard**: Grove cards, metrics display, quick actions
- **Data Studio**: Table rendering, filters, session management
- **Experiments**: Wizard forms, result visualization
- **Projects**: CRUD operations, file uploads
- **Accounts**: Authentication, settings, profile management

### Component Integration Testing
- Grove design system component consistency
- Modal and dropdown functionality
- Form validation and submission
- Error handling and user feedback

### Performance Testing Scenarios
- Initial page load performance
- Navigation transition performance
- Large dataset rendering (Data Studio)
- Mobile device performance
- Bundle size and asset optimization

## Files to Create/Modify
- `tests/playwright/` (comprehensive test suite)
- `tests/performance/` (performance benchmarking)
- `tests/accessibility/` (accessibility validation)
- `playwright.config.js` (Playwright configuration)
- `.github/workflows/` (CI integration)
- `package.json` (test scripts and dependencies)

## Testing Requirements
- Run tests in Docker environment
- Test with real database connections and data
- Validate against production-like configurations
- Include error condition and edge case testing
- Implement test result reporting and monitoring
