# Task: Alpine.js Integration Optimization

## Description
Optimize Alpine.js and script loading order to create proper component initialization patterns. Test all interactive functionality and components, including theme switching and user interface state management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Optimize Alpine.js loading order and initialization sequence
- [ ] Create proper component initialization patterns for Grove components
- [ ] Implement centralized Alpine.js store for global state management
- [ ] Test all interactive functionality across all pages and components
- [ ] Verify theme switching works correctly with Alpine.js state
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup and memory management for Alpine components
- [ ] Create Alpine.js component documentation and usage patterns
- [ ] Verify compatibility with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks

## Technical Details
- Optimize static/js/alpine/hydro-ml-app.js for proper initialization order
- Create Alpine.js stores for theme state, user preferences, and UI state
- Implement proper Alpine.js component lifecycle management
- Create reusable Alpine.js directives for common UI patterns
- Test Alpine.js integration with Grove modal, navigation, and card components
- Verify Alpine.js works correctly with data_tools TanStack table implementation
- Test experiments ML wizard Alpine.js integration
- Ensure proper script loading order: Alpine.js → Grove components → App-specific scripts
- Create Alpine.js debugging and development utilities

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 005 - Base Template Restructure Implementation (template structure ready)
- [ ] Alpine.js framework available and properly configured
- [ ] Grove design system components implemented

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10-12
- Parallel: false
