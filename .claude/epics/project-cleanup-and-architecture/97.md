# Task: Base Template Restructure Implementation

## Description
Restructure base_main.html with proper inheritance patterns, reducing it from 440+ lines to under 150 lines by extracting inline CSS and scripts to dedicated files. Implement reusable panel patterns for modals and comprehensive testing of all pages and functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Restructure base_main.html to under 150 lines with proper inheritance
- [ ] Extract all inline CSS to dedicated component files
- [ ] Extract all inline JavaScript to dedicated files with proper loading order
- [ ] Implement reusable panel patterns for modal and overlay components
- [ ] Create modular head section with proper meta tag management
- [ ] Test all pages render correctly with restructured template
- [ ] Verify all interactive functionality remains intact
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works across all viewport sizes

## Technical Details
- Refactor core/templates/core/base_main.html to use extracted components
- Create core/static/core/css/partials/ directory for extracted inline styles
