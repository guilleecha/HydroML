# Task #7: Update grove_demo.html with Enhanced Headbar

**Epic**: Enhanced Grove Headbar  
**Phase**: Grove Demo Integration  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Dependencies**: Task #6  

## Objective
Replace the current headbar implementation in `grove_demo.html` with the enhanced two-row design, ensuring full functionality and visual consistency with the dashboard design.

## Scope
- Update grove_demo.html template to use enhanced WaveHeadbar
- Configure Alpine.js data for two-row layout demonstration
- Implement mock data for counts and breadcrumb navigation
- Ensure responsive design works properly on mobile devices

## Deliverables
- [ ] Updated grove_demo.html with two-row headbar
- [ ] Configured Alpine.js data for demo functionality
- [ ] Mock data implementation for realistic demonstration
- [ ] Mobile responsive verification

## Technical Details
### Template Updates
```html
<!-- Replace existing headbar in grove_demo.html -->
<div x-data="WaveHeadbar.createAlpineData({
    layoutMode: 'two-row',
    showBreadcrumbs: true,
    breadcrumbStyle: 'character-based',
    showTabCounts: true,
    tabCountsData: {
        workspaces: 12,
        datasources: 25,
        experiments: 8
    },
    currentBreadcrumb: '@demo-user'
})" x-init="init()">
    <!-- Two-row headbar implementation -->
</div>
```

### Mock Data Configuration
- Realistic count numbers for demonstration
- Sample breadcrumb contexts for different page states
- Mock search functionality with sample results
- Simulated user interaction states

### Demo Scenarios
1. **Dashboard Context**: `@demo-user` with overview counts
2. **Workspace Context**: `@demo-user/~sample-workspace` with project-specific data
3. **Experiment Context**: `@demo-user/~sample-workspace/#model-training`
4. **Search Demo**: Working examples of character-prefixed search

### Integration Points
- Connect with existing Grove demo navigation
- Preserve existing component demonstration functionality
- Maintain theme switching compatibility
- Ensure all interactive elements work properly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] grove_demo.html displays two-row headbar correctly
- [ ] All navigation tabs show appropriate count badges
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation displays current context
- [ ] Search functionality demonstrates character prefixes
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works on all device sizes
- [ ] Theme switching affects headbar properly
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] Page load time remains under 2 seconds

## Implementation Notes
- Test in both light and dark themes
- Verify compatibility with existing Alpine.js components in demo
- Ensure mock data feels realistic for demonstration purposes
- Consider adding demo-specific interactive tutorials or tooltips
- Document any new features for user testing and feedback
- Test thoroughly on mobile devices and different screen sizes
