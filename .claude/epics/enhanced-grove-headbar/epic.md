# Epic: Enhanced Grove Headbar

## Overview
Implementation of a sophisticated two-row headbar design with universal search and contextual breadcrumb navigation. This epic enhances the existing Grove headbar component to match the professional GitHub-style interface while introducing innovative character-prefixed search functionality and dynamic workspace context awareness.

## Business Objectives
- **Navigation Efficiency**: <3 clicks to reach any main section (Dashboard, Workspace, Data Sources, Experiments)
- **User Comprehension**: Users understand current context within 2 seconds of page load
- **Search Productivity**: 80% faster content discovery through character-prefixed search
- **Visual Consistency**: 100% design token compliance with existing dashboard headbar

## Epic Scope
Based on the Enhanced Grove Headbar PRD, this epic addresses:
- Current Grove headbar lacks sophisticated two-row design pattern
- Missing contextual breadcrumb navigation with special character system
- Limited search functionality without intelligent content filtering
- Inconsistency between grove_demo.html and existing dashboard design
- Need for dynamic count displays and real-time workspace awareness

## Technical Architecture
- **Base Reference**: `core/templates/core/base_github_style.html` (lines 148-354)
- **Component Integration**: Enhanced `WaveHeadbar.js` with two-row Alpine.js data structure
- **Search Engine**: Universal search with character prefixes (@, #, &, ~)
- **Backend Integration**: Django context processors for real-time counts and breadcrumb data

## Success Metrics
- Navigation click efficiency (target: <3 clicks average)
- Component render performance (<200ms state changes)
- Search result relevance (>90% user satisfaction)
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 1**: Analysis & Integration (Days 1-4) - Tasks #1, #2, #3
- **Phase 2**: Component Enhancement (Days 5-11) - Tasks #4, #5, #6
- **Phase 3**: Grove Demo Integration (Days 12-15) - Tasks #7, #8, #9

## Tasks Created
- [ ] #40 - Extract and Analyze Two-Row Template Structure (parallel: true)
- [ ] #41 - Integrate HTML Structure with WaveHeadbar Component (parallel: false)
- [ ] #42 - Implement Django Context Data Integration (parallel: false)
- [ ] #43 - Develop Special Character Breadcrumb System (parallel: false)
- [ ] #44 - Build Universal Search with Character Prefixes (parallel: false)
- [ ] #45 - Create Dynamic Count System and Alpine.js Data Binding (parallel: false)
- [ ] #46 - Update grove_demo.html with Enhanced Headbar (parallel: false)
- [ ] #47 - Optimize CSS for Two-Row Layout Support (parallel: false)
- [ ] #48 - Testing, Validation and Performance Verification (parallel: false)

Total tasks: 9
Parallel tasks: 1
Sequential tasks: 8
Estimated total effort: 50-65 hours

## Dependencies
- Existing `base_github_style.html` template structure
- Current `WaveHeadbar.js` component architecture
- Django view context variables for counts (workspaces, data sources, experiments)
- Grove design tokens and CSS system
- Alpine.js framework compatibility

## Special Character System Implementation
- `@` **Username/Profile**: User context and navigation
- `#` **Experiments**: ML experiments and research
- `&` **Database**: Database connections and data sources
- `~` **Workspace**: Project workspaces and environments

## Search Integration Examples
- `@guer` → Search users: @guillermo, @guest_user
- `~hydro` → Search workspaces: ~hydroml-workspace, ~hydro-analytics
- `#train` → Search experiments: #model-training, #training-v2
- `&post` → Search databases: &postgres-prod, &postgresql-dev
- `analytics` → Global search (no prefix = search all types)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Component Compatibility**: Thorough testing with existing Alpine.js infrastructure
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor page load times and component render speeds
- **Search Scalability**: Implement efficient backend queries with proper indexing
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure two-row design adapts to mobile viewports

## Definition of Done
- All 9 tasks completed and tested
- Two-row headbar fully functional in grove_demo.html
- Universal search system operational with character prefixes
- Dynamic counts display real-time data
- Component performance meets <200ms render target
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) achieved
- Integration matches base_github_style.html behavior
