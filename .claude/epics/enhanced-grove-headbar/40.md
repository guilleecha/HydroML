# Task #1: Extract and Analyze Two-Row Template Structure

**Epic**: Enhanced Grove Headbar  
**Phase**: Analysis & Integration  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Dependencies**: None  

## Objective
Extract the two-row headbar template structure from `base_github_style.html` and analyze its implementation for integration with the WaveHeadbar component.

## Scope
- Study existing two-row design in `core/templates/core/base_github_style.html` (lines 148-354)
- Document CSS classes and structure patterns
- Identify Django context variables used for dynamic content
- Map existing functionality to WaveHeadbar requirements

## Deliverables
- [ ] Complete structural analysis document
- [ ] CSS class mapping for both rows
- [ ] Context variable documentation (user data, counts, navigation state)
- [ ] Integration compatibility assessment

## Technical Details
### Row 1 Analysis (Primary Header)
- Background: `bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900`
- Content: Grove icon (w-12 h-12), username (@{{ user.username }}), search bar, actions
- Layout: Flexbox with justify-between spacing

### Row 2 Analysis (Secondary Navigation)
- Background: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900`
- Content: Navigation tabs with counts and active state indicators
- Styling: Border-bottom active states with orange accent

### Context Variables Required
- `user.username` for @ breadcrumb
- `total_workspaces_count`, `total_datasources_count`, `total_experiments_count`
- Current route/page context for active tab highlighting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Template structure documented with exact CSS classes
- [ ] All dynamic content placeholders identified
- [ ] Context variable requirements specified
- [ ] Compatibility assessment with WaveHeadbar completed
- [ ] Integration approach documented

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on preserving existing responsive design patterns
- Document mobile menu collapsing behavior
- Note Alpine.js data binding requirements for dropdowns and state management
- Identify areas where WaveHeadbar.js methods need extension
