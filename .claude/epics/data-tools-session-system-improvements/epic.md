# Epic: Data Tools Session System Improvements

## Overview

Consolidate the dual session implementation (Redis-based and file-based) into a single, robust Redis-based system with complete undo/redo functionality, improved security, and configurable session management. This technical implementation addresses architectural debt while maintaining backward compatibility and improving user experience.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Single Session Implementation**: Consolidate to Redis-based system, deprecate file-based approach
- **Secure Serialization**: Replace pickle with JSON + compression for data safety
- **Configurable Timeouts**: Move from hardcoded 4-hour timeout to user/admin configurable settings
- **Event-Driven UI**: Maintain existing SessionManager/SessionUIController architecture
- **Atomic Operations**: Implement transaction-like behavior for data transformation steps
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics collection for session operations

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Enhanced SessionManager**: Add missing redo logic completion
- **Session State UI**: Visual indicators for session health and timeout warnings
- **Operation Preview**: Show preview of undo/redo operations before execution
- **Timeout Management**: User-friendly session extension prompts
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and recovery options

### Backend Services
- **Unified SessionManager**: Single `session_manager.py` with complete functionality
- **Security Layer**: Safe serialization without pickle vulnerabilities
- **Configuration Service**: Admin-configurable session parameters
- **Cleanup Service**: Automated session garbage collection
- **Audit Trail**: Operation logging for debugging and compliance

### Data Models and Schema
- **Session Metadata**: Enhanced tracking of operation history
- **User Preferences**: Session timeout preferences per user
- **Operation Log**: Detailed audit trail of data transformations
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and success rates

### Infrastructure
- **Redis Optimization**: Efficient key structure and memory management
- **Monitoring**: Session operation metrics and alerts
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling preparation for session storage
- **Backup Strategy**: Session data backup and recovery procedures

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- Complete audit of existing dual implementation
- Design unified session architecture
- Implement comprehensive test suite
- Set up monitoring infrastructure

**Phase 2: Core Implementation (Week 2-3)**
- Implement unified SessionManager with security improvements
- Complete redo functionality implementation
- Add configurable session timeouts
- Implement atomic operations

**Phase 3: Migration and Polish (Week 4)**
- Migrate existing sessions to new system
- Performance optimization and load testing
- Documentation and deployment preparation
- User acceptance testing

### Risk Mitigation
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive session backup before migration
- Rollback procedures for production deployment
- Load testing with realistic data volumes

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for all session operations
- Integration tests for UI/backend coordination
- Performance tests for large dataset handling
- Security tests for serialization safety
- User acceptance tests for workflow continuity
