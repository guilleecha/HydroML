# Task: Consolidate Dual Implementation into Single System

## Description
Consolidate the dual session implementation by deprecating the file-based session_service.py system and migrating all functionality to the improved Redis-based session_manager.py. Ensure seamless migration of existing sessions and remove all redundant code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Migrate all session_service.py functionality to session_manager.py
- [ ] Create migration tool for existing file-based sessions to Redis
- [ ] Update all API endpoints to use single session system
- [ ] Remove session_service.py and related file-based code
- [ ] Update frontend to use unified session interface
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility during migration period
- [ ] Add feature flags for gradual rollout
- [ ] Complete end-to-end testing of unified system

## Technical Details
- **Migration scope**:
  - All functionality from `session_service.py` → `session_manager.py`
  - File-based sessions → Redis storage
  - API endpoints standardized on single interface
  - Frontend calls updated to unified system
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Feature flags for A/B testing during migration
  - Background migration job for existing sessions
  - Gradual deprecation warnings in old system
  - Comprehensive testing suite for unified system
- **Files affected**:
  - Remove: `data_tools/services/session_service.py`
  - Update: All API endpoints using session services
  - Update: Frontend session handling code
  - Update: Tests and documentation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Architecture design) completed
- [ ] Task 002 (JSON serialization) completed 
- [ ] Task 003 (Redo functionality) completed
- [ ] Migration testing environment ready

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 24-30 hours
- Parallel: false (requires completed foundation tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Single unified session system operational
- [ ] All file-based session functionality migrated
- [ ] Migration tool successfully moves existing sessions
- [ ] session_service.py and related code removed
- [ ] All API endpoints use unified interface
- [ ] Frontend updated and tested with new system
- [ ] Feature flags implemented for safe rollout
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show improvement or parity
- [ ] Full regression testing passed
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture
