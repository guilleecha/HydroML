# Task: Complete Redo Functionality Implementation

## Description
Complete the missing redo functionality in session_manager.py by implementing proper forward transformation replay logic. The current redo_last_operation() method has placeholder logic that needs to be fully implemented with proper state management and error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace placeholder logic in redo_last_operation() (lines 150-183)
- [ ] Implement forward transformation replay mechanism
- [ ] Add proper state validation for redo operations
- [ ] Ensure redo history is maintained correctly
- [ ] Handle edge cases (no operations to redo, invalid state)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Verify redo operations can be undone again
- [ ] UI properly reflects redo availability and operation success

## Technical Details
- **Primary file**: `data_tools/services/session_manager.py` (lines 150-183)
- **Current issue**: Method returns placeholder success without actual operation
- **Implementation requirements**:
  - Maintain separate undo and redo stacks
  - Replay transformations from operation history
  - Validate data integrity before/after redo
  - Update session metadata (shape, operations count)
  - Emit proper events for UI updates
- **Integration points**:
  - API endpoint: `session_api_views.py` redo handler
  - Frontend: Session UI controller redo button state
  - History management: Operation log consistency

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Architecture design) defines operation history format
- [ ] Understanding of current transformation types and their replay logic
- [ ] Access to UI testing framework for validation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: false (conflicts with serialization changes)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Redo functionality fully implemented and working
- [ ] All operation types can be redone correctly
- [ ] Redo history maintained properly with undo/redo cycles
- [ ] Edge cases handled with appropriate error messages
- [ ] Integration tests verify redo operations work end-to-end
- [ ] UI correctly shows redo availability and feedback
- [ ] Performance acceptable for typical redo operations
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
