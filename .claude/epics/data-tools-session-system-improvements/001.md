# Task: Audit Dual Session Implementation and Design Unified Architecture

## Description
Perform comprehensive audit of the current dual session implementation (Redis-based session_manager.py vs file-based session_service.py) and design a unified architecture that consolidates both systems into a single, robust solution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete analysis of session_manager.py functionality and limitations
- [ ] Complete analysis of session_service.py functionality and usage
- [ ] Document current data flow and dependencies between both systems
- [ ] Identify code duplication and inconsistencies between implementations
- [ ] Design unified session architecture with clear interfaces
- [ ] Define migration strategy from dual to single implementation
- [ ] Create architectural diagram showing new unified system

## Technical Details
- **Files to analyze**: 
  - `data_tools/services/session_manager.py`
  - `data_tools/services/session_service.py`
  - Related API endpoints in `session_api_views.py`
  - Frontend session handling in `data_studio_sidebar.js`
- **Key considerations**:
  - Performance characteristics of each approach
  - Data persistence guarantees
  - Error handling mechanisms
  - Memory usage patterns
- **Design requirements**:
  - Single source of truth for session state
  - Backward compatibility during migration
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Extensible for future features

## Dependencies
- [ ] Access to current codebase and documentation
- [ ] Understanding of current user workflows
- [ ] Redis infrastructure assessment

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other design tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Comprehensive audit document created
- [ ] Unified architecture design document completed
- [ ] Migration strategy documented with risk assessment
- [ ] Architecture reviewed and approved by technical lead
- [ ] Foundation for implementation tasks established
