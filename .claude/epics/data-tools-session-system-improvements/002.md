# Task: Replace Pickle Serialization with JSON for Security

## Description
Replace the current pickle-based serialization in session_manager.py with secure JSON serialization to eliminate security vulnerabilities while maintaining data integrity and performance. Implement proper data validation and error handling for the new serialization approach.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove all pickle.loads() and pickle.dumps() usage from session_manager.py
- [ ] Implement JSON serialization with proper DataFrame handling
- [ ] Add data validation layer to prevent corrupted session data
- [ ] Implement backward compatibility for existing pickled sessions
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Ensure performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] All existing session functionality works with new serialization

## Technical Details
- **Primary file**: `data_tools/services/session_manager.py` (line 249 and related)
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Use JSON for metadata and operation history
  - Convert DataFrame to/from JSON-compatible format (dict/records)
  - Implement custom serializer class for complex data types
  - Add compression to maintain performance
- **Data transformation needed**:
  - DataFrame → dict/records → JSON
  - Numpy arrays → Python lists → JSON
  - Datetime objects → ISO strings → JSON
- **Backward compatibility**:
  - Detect pickle vs JSON format on load
  - Migrate existing sessions during first access
  - Graceful fallback for corrupted data

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Architecture design) must define data structures
- [ ] Testing framework ready for serialization validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking tools available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false (conflicts with redo implementation due to shared code)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Pickle serialization completely removed
- [ ] JSON serialization implemented and tested
- [ ] Data validation layer in place
- [ ] Backward compatibility verified with existing sessions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show acceptable or improved performance
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] All tests passing with new serialization
- [ ] Documentation updated
