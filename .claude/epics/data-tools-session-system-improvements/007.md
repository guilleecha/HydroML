# Task: Session Monitoring and Health Observability

## Description
Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability for the session system including metrics collection, health checks, alerting, and operational dashboards. Enable proactive identification of issues and performance optimization opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Session operation metrics collection (response times, error rates)
- [ ] Redis connection and health monitoring
- [ ] Session lifecycle tracking (creation, modification, expiry)
- [ ] Memory usage and performance metrics
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting system
- [ ] Operational dashboard for session system health
- [ ] Automated cleanup of expired sessions
- [ ] Capacity planning metrics and alerts

## Technical Details
- **Metrics to collect**:
  - Session operation latency (P50, P95, P99)
  - Session creation/deletion rates
  - Error rates by operation type
  - Redis connection pool utilization
  - Memory usage per session
  - Active session counts
  - Data size distribution
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Integration with existing Sentry error tracking
  - Custom Django metrics collection
  - Redis monitoring via INFO command
  - Periodic health check endpoints
  - Automated alerting for anomalies
- **Observability components**:
  - Health check endpoint for load balancers
  - Metrics export for monitoring systems
  - Structured logging for debugging
  - Performance profiling hooks

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 005 (Consolidation) completed for stable system
- [ ] Sentry monitoring infrastructure available
- [ ] Metrics collection system (Prometheus/similar) configured
- [ ] Alerting system setup (email/Slack integration)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 14-18 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside testing tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All key metrics are collected and exported
- [ ] Health check endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard shows session system status
- [ ] Automated alerts trigger for critical issues
- [ ] Session cleanup job runs reliably
- [ ] Performance metrics baseline established
- [ ] Error tracking captures and categorizes issues
- [ ] Documentation for monitoring setup and troubleshooting
- [ ] Runbook for common operational tasks
