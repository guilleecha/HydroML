# Task: Complete Toolbox-Session Integration

## Description
Implement missing JavaScript handlers and API connections to fully integrate toolbox editing actions with the session system. Currently only 2 of 20+ toolbox actions are functional, leaving users unable to perform most data transformations through the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement all missing action handlers in data_studio_sidebar.js
- [ ] Connect toolbox actions to existing transformation APIs  
- [ ] Add missing API method calls in data_studio_api.js
- [ ] Ensure all toolbox operations properly update session state
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for toolbox operations
- [ ] Implement progress indicators for long-running operations
- [ ] Validate session state synchronization after transformations
- [ ] Add user feedback for successful/failed operations

## Technical Details
- **Missing implementations** (80% of toolbox):
  - Feature Engineering: encoding, scaling, binning
  - Data Quality: outlier treatment, duplicate handling
  - Column Operations: rename, drop, duplicate, reorder
  - Export Functions: CSV, Excel, JSON export with session state
  - Advanced Tools: custom transformations, batch operations
- **Files to update**:
  - `data_tools/static/data_tools/js/data_studio_sidebar.js` (add switch case handlers)
  - `data_tools/static/data_tools/js/data_studio_api.js` (add API methods)
  - UI feedback and progress indicators
- **Integration pattern**:
  ```javascript
  // Each toolbox action should:
  1. Show loading state
  2. Call appropriate API endpoint
  3. Handle success/error responses  
  4. Update session state
  5. Refresh data grid
  6. Show user feedback
  ```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Architecture audit) identifies all required integrations
- [ ] Existing transformation APIs documented and tested
- [ ] Session manager functionality confirmed working
- [ ] UI components ready for loading states and feedback

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 28-35 hours  
- Parallel: true (can implement alongside session improvements)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 20+ toolbox actions have working JavaScript handlers
- [ ] Every toolbox operation integrates with session system
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling prevents UI breakage
- [ ] User feedback clearly indicates operation success/failure
- [ ] Session state correctly updated after each transformation
- [ ] Data grid refreshes automatically after operations
- [ ] Loading indicators show during long operations
- [ ] Integration tests verify toolbox-session workflow
- [ ] User acceptance testing confirms improved functionality
