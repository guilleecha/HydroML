# Task: Comprehensive Testing and Performance Validation

## Description
Implement comprehensive test suite for the unified session system and conduct performance validation to ensure the new implementation meets or exceeds current performance standards. Include load testing, security testing, and user acceptance testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all session manager methods (100% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- [ ] Load testing with realistic data volumes (up to 100MB datasets)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against current implementation
- [ ] Security testing for serialization and Redis access
- [ ] Memory usage profiling and optimization
- [ ] Concurrent user testing (100+ simultaneous sessions)
- [ ] Error recovery and resilience testing

## Technical Details
- **Test categories**:
  - Unit: Individual session operations (create, save, load, undo, redo)
  - Integration: API endpoints, Redis interaction, data persistence
  - E2E: Complete user workflows from session creation to save
  - Performance: Response time, memory usage, concurrent access
  - Security: Data validation, access control, serialization safety
- **Testing tools**:
  - pytest for unit and integration tests
  - Locust or similar for load testing
  - Memory profilers for optimization
  - Security scanners for vulnerability testing
- **Performance targets**:
  - Session operations < 200ms (P95)
  - Undo/redo operations < 100ms (P95)
  - Support 100+ concurrent sessions
  - Memory usage optimized vs current implementation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 005 (Consolidation) completed
- [ ] Testing environment with Redis and database setup
- [ ] Load testing tools configured
- [ ] Performance baseline from current system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside monitoring setup)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Test suite implemented with 100% coverage
- [ ] All tests passing consistently
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets
- [ ] Load testing validates concurrent user support
- [ ] Security testing shows no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Memory usage optimized and documented
- [ ] Performance regression testing framework established
- [ ] Test results documented and reviewed
- [ ] Continuous integration pipeline includes all tests
