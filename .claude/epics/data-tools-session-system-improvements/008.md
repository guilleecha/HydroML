# Task: Production Deployment and Migration

## Description
Execute the production deployment of the unified session system with zero-downtime migration strategy. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout, monitor system health during migration, and ensure rollback capability for any issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feature flags implemented for gradual user rollout
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment strategy executed
- [ ] Production session data migration completed successfully
- [ ] System health monitoring during deployment
- [ ] Rollback plan tested and ready
- [ ] User communication about changes (if any impact)
- [ ] Post-deployment validation of all functionality
- [ ] Performance monitoring shows stable or improved metrics

## Technical Details
- **Deployment strategy**:
  - Feature flags for percentage-based rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
  - Blue-green deployment for API changes
  - Database migrations with backward compatibility
  - Redis data migration with validation
- **Migration approach**:
  - Background job to convert existing sessions
  - Dual-read mode during transition period
  - Validation of migrated session data integrity
  - Cleanup of old session files after successful migration
- **Monitoring during deployment**:
  - Real-time error rate monitoring
  - Performance metrics comparison
  - User experience impact assessment
  - Redis and database health monitoring

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 005 (Consolidation) completed and tested
- [ ] Task 006 (Testing) passed all validation
- [ ] Task 007 (Monitoring) operational
- [ ] Production environment ready (Redis, database capacity)
- [ ] Deployment pipeline configured and tested

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all foundation tasks completed)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Production deployment completed without downtime
- [ ] All existing sessions migrated successfully
- [ ] Feature flags allow controlled rollout
- [ ] System health metrics remain stable or improve
- [ ] No critical issues reported during migration
- [ ] Rollback plan validated and ready
- [ ] User experience unchanged or improved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met in production
- [ ] Old system components safely deprecated
- [ ] Post-deployment review completed with lessons learned
